# SimpleCampfire
A simple campfire. Right click with four sticks on cobble to get a campfire.

It lights up the night. It glows blue when monsters are near. Soon, it'll cook your food.
You don't need a crafting table. You don't even need to open your inventory. All you need is four sticks and a piece of cobblestone.
